Engineering Leader | Bangalore, India

Engineering leader with **14+ years of experience** building and scaling low-latency, high-throughput platforms in fintech, insurance, and e-commerce. I lead organizations of 15+ engineers, owning mission-critical backend systems end-to-end — from architecture and design through production operations.

My work sits at the intersection of **engineering depth and organizational leadership** — architecting systems that handle 25K–30K+ RPM under strict correctness and regulatory constraints, while building teams and processes that deliver predictably in fast-moving environments.
