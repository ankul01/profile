Senior Engineering Manager with 14+ years of experience building and scaling backend and platform systems in fintech, insurance, and e-commerce.

Passionate about leading teams that build **mission-critical, high-throughput systems** where reliability, compliance, and customer impact matter. I enjoy operating at the intersection of engineering, product, and business — turning complex problems into scalable, durable platforms.

I write about system design, platform architecture, and engineering leadership. My latest post dives into [**Designing an Embedded Insurance Platform**](/profile/posts/tech-blogs/embedded-insurance/) — a comprehensive architecture blueprint covering product engines, issuance pipelines, double-entry ledgering, and regulatory reporting. Built for EMs and Staff Engineers working in insurtech and fintech.
